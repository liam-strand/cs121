### List one section of the code that is relevant to you as a CS student (rather than as a professional), and briefly explain why.

Section 1.5 is especially important for students. It is very easy to pass of someone else's work as one's own. Even if a student does not commit an academic integrity violation, there are still important "best practices" they should follow. We should hold ourselves to a higher standard than just "not doing something terribly wrong". For example, I strongly believe that a student must note any TAs that they received help from. Even though a student should not use the TA's code directly, the TA's ideas are likely going to be pivotal in the success of the student and that contribution should be recognized.

### The code is somewhat aspirational. Very briefly, give a scenario in which a private company's goals might be reasonable yet may conflict with some part of the code.

A private company's goal is usually to increase revenue and accumulate wealth. If a company is maintaining a legacy product that many people use, but no one is purchasing, they are losing money on every bug fix and security patch because that labor is going uncompensated. A company may reasonably decide to stop supporting a product like that because it is no longer in their financial interest, violating section 3.6.
