### What was the most surprising characteristic to you of a great software engineering, as described by the paper?

One particularly surprising characteristic was the importance of being knowledgeable about the people and the organization one is working in. Of course, after the paper spells it out, it is obvious that knowing who has what expertise, and which customers are keeping the lights on and what services those customers use would be incredibly important and helpful information for a software engineer when they need to decide how to delegate tasks or balance tradeoffs.

### What are some things you might want to do on your own, after this course ends, to become a great software engineer?

I want to do my very best to keep up-to-date with trends in programming languages and software engineering. I am certain that there are many innovations that are yet to come in this field and I want to know about them as soon as possible. Furthermore, following trends in programming languages will be helpful because it will stop my skills from stagnating by forcing me to try new programming paradigms and learn new idioms.
